 * the time consuming program.
 *
 * since the task is long-running, there are two options:
 * - use async/await
 * - use worker threads
 *
 * if the task is a heavy task, it could block the event loop (main thread) and
 * cause the application unresponsive and cannot handle other events like pause or abort.
 * in this case, you can use worker threads to run the task in a separate thread, but still,
 * if the task is heavy enough, the separate thread will be blocked and cannot handle events from the main thread,
 * it only guarantee that the main thread will not be blocked.
 *
 * it's common to separate a heavy task into smaller blocks using setInterval(), this way you don't
 * necessarily to create a new thread for the task. setInterval() allows you to update the progress or status,
 * the processing time for each smaller block should be short enough to not block the event loop.
